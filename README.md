## Build Process

If you want to build this app yourself, then here are the requirements for the build:
- **Xcode 12**
- **Firebase**: Firebase Cloudstore is used to store and get Flash Cards in real time. And download the GoogleService-Info.plist file from Firebase console to your xcode project.
- **CocoaPods**: CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C projects. You can install it by using ```brew install cocoapods``` in macOS terminal.
- **macOS Big Sur Recommended**
